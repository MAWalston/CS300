What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For project one I wrote pseudocode to print a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and print out its title and prerequisites.
For Project two I was trying to create a menu the would read the data and list out the classes. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this by thinking of the strcture of what needed to be created and applied that to writing out the code. Data strucutres are important to understand because its literally the building block of software. If you don't know what goes where and how, code will not be able to function with data. For writing the code I wanted to make sure the menu and class structure populated correctly. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I was having problems with the sorting algorithm where I couldnt get the right classes to populate. Which I verified the logic, loop conditions, variable assignments, and comparison operations.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I've learned to break down complex problems into manageable tasks, employ modular design for code reusability and maintainability, select appropriate algorithms and data structures for optimal performance, implement robust error handling and input validation, thoroughly test and debug code, document effectively.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
These projects have given me the opportunity to understand the balance between the three. More practice with each one and putting them together to create a database.
